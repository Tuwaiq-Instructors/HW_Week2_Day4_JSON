    // You've just been hired as a junior web developer at a park.  A park unlike any other.
    // Your new boss, Nedry, has tasked you with some JSON related work.
    // You need to create some Dinosaur objects:
 
    /* 
    Each object should have the following properties, with relevant data types:
        -- species, genus, nickname, and a descriptive adjective reflective of that dinosaur's personality. (strings)
        -- method 'trample' -> which when called, issues an ALERT that says "Watch Out!  <nickname> is on the loose!". (method/function)
        -- an array of favorite foods. (array)
        -- age (number)
    */

    // Your objective is to create an array, with atleast three dinosaur objects inside of it.
    // The favorite foods should be a property, with a value that is an array of favorite foods.

    // Remember the keyword "this" when you're creating your method for each object.

    // Create ATLEAST three dinosaurs!
    // The output should look like this:
    /*
        Dinosaur 1: 
        Dopey, a wistful Ceratosaurus nasicornis is 33 years old. 
        Their favorite foods are flying squirrels and chicken. 
        
        Dinosaur 2: 
        Bitey, a solitary Tyrannosaurus rex is 27 years old. 
        Their favorite foods are carcasses, mammals and other dinosaurs. 
        
        Dinosaur 3:
        Buttons, a family-oriented Stegosaurus armatus is 38 years old. 
        Their favorite foods are grass and leaves.
